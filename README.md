# SAVT-Dashboard
> [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) project for **Liquid Galaxy** [organization](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB).

Browser client side of Smart Agro Visualization Tool (*SAVT*) project.

SAVT is a web application that creates a friendly non-expert user experience to visualize smart agriculture data grouped in two types (sensors and drone images) and send them to a [Liquid Galaxy](https://github.com/LiquidGalaxy/liquid-galaxy/wiki).

## Getting started

### Installation

```shell
git clone git@github.com:calv00/SAVT-Dashboard.git
cd dashboardproject
sudo npm install
```
SAVT-Dashboard is prepared to get its data from a public server (**sensor-api**), and send orders to a local server(**kml-server**) to deploy information on Liquid Galaxy. These two servers are located in [SmartAgroVisualizationTool](https://github.com/calv00/SmartAgroVisualizationTool) repository. To accomplish this, its necessary to add the addresses (with its ports) to the file [*src/app/shared/environments/config.ts*](https://github.com/calv00/SAVT-Dashboard/blob/master/src/app/shared/environments/config.ts) :
```
export class appConfig {

    // publicApiEndpoint is the address of the sensor-api endpoint server
    public static publicApiEndpoint = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_API_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS';

    // localApiEndpoint is the address of the kml-server endpoint server
    public static localApiEndpoint = 'YOUR_LOCAL_API_ENDPOINT_ADDRESS';
}
```

 The default ports of the servers are:
- [sensor-api](https://github.com/calv00/SmartAgroVisualizationTool/tree/master/sensor-api) : 3002
- [kml-server](https://github.com/calv00/SmartAgroVisualizationTool/tree/master/kml-server) : 3003

### Usage

```shell
npm start
```

## Developing

### Built With
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Information
This app is configured to run on port 3001. To change the port, the file [bs-config.json](https://github.com/calv00/SAVT-Dashboard/blob/master/bs-config.json) has to be modified:
```
{
  "port": 3001,
  "server": {
    ...
    }
  },
  ...
}
```

#### Future work
| Feature                   | Status      |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| Deploy on public server   | Not planned |
